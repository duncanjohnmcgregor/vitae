### **vitae**
*leave your legacy*


**vitae is an application that:**
- connects "listeners" to "storytellers"
- has both a vitae-run in-person white glove service and a media platform with two-sided content strategy
- media platform will be monetized through ads, white glove service will be a location agnostic high margin premium offering 
- revenue sharing for stories published on media platform

**vitae growth plan:**

- Vitae built first - run as a high-touch ai assisted in person business
    - build out framework for recording support - ai to record conversations, process, generate initial & follow up questions, create transcript
    - build out framework for editing output - ai assisted tooling to parse through videos, select clips, edit together, create physical packaging, burn to external media
    - separately scale this as a business and have shared technology with media platform

- free option built next - setting up a video streaming media platform:
    - decide on how content will be consumed e.g. audio and/or video content, length (youtube vs tiktok style)
    -  build framework for consuming content e.g. video explorer/for you page
    - figure out how this interlocks with paid option for initial bootstrap - can we offer customers of the in person the chance to get it for a discount/free if they allow us to edit & upload their content?

- then 2 sided marketplace - enabling creator economy in free option:
    - figure out how we enable other people to use our ai tooling to create their own interviews with people they know, for some share of the revenue
